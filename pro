About me
I am currently an lecturer at Chang’an University. I've received the bachelor, Ph.D. degree (supervised by Prof. Liejin Guo) from Xi'an Jiaotong University from 2015 and2023, respectively. I joined the School of Energy and Electrical Engineering of Chang’an University in 2023.

My research area is Marine oil and gas transportation flow safety assurance, Two-phase/multiphase flow measurement and simulation.
